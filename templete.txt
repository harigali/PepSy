# PepSy sequence configuration file

# ss = Synthesis scale 1 for 50 micromol and 2 for 100 micromol
# seq = Peptide sequence
# pa = Position assignement for amino acids/reagents by the script (y or n). If n, then provide positions in the section [Positions] (e.g., A = 7)
# saa = Position of the amino acid number from were synthesis starts
# pr = Priming step requirement (y or n)
# sw = Swelling step requirement (y or n)
# dp = Initial deprotection step requirement (y or n)
# fw = Final washing and drying steps requiremnt (y or n)

# Use uppercase letters for L amino acids
# Use lowercase alphabets for D amino acids
# Use '<', '>', '-', '+', and '=' for N-methyl amino acids
# Use '3', '4', '5', '6', and '8' for beta-alanine, 4-aminobutanoic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid linker and place the solution in the position assigned to "3", "4", "5", "6", or "8" respectively
# Use 'X' and 'B' for H2N-PEG2-COOH and H2N-PEG3-COOH linker respectively
# Use 'J', '1', '2', '7', or '9' for a linker (other than beta-alanine, 4-aminobutanoic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, H2N-PEG2-COOH, H2N-PEG3-COOH), an unusual amino acid or any molecule that requires both coupling and fmoc deprotection and place the solution in the position assigned to "J", "1", "2", "7", or "9" respectively
# Use 'Z' for tris t-butyl protected DOTA and place the DOTA solution in the position assigned to "Z".
# Use 'U' or 'O' for a chelator (other than tris t-butyl protected DOTA), an unusual amino acid, or any molecule that requires only coupling and place the solution in the position assigned to  "U" or "O" respectively
# Use '#' for manually added amino acid
# Use '*' for pausing the synthesis
# Use '!' for ivDde deprotection and place the hydrazine solution in the position assigned to "B"
# Use '@' for onresin oxidation and place the thallium solution in the position assigned to "O"
# Use '$' for end-capping and place the acetic anhydride solution in the position assigned to "U"
