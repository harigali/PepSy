# PepSy sequence configuration file

# ss = Synthesis scale 1 for 50 micromol and 2 for 100 micromol
# seq = Peptide sequence
# pa = Position assignement for amino acids/reagents by the script (y or n). If n, then provide positions in the section [Positions] (e.g., A = 7)
# saa = Position of the amino acid number from were synthesis starts
# pr = Priming step requirement (y or n)
# sw = Swelling step requirement (y or n)
# dp = Initial deprotection step requirement (y or n)
# fw = Final washing and drying steps requiremnt (y or n)

# Use uppercase letters for both L and D amino acids.
# Use lowercase alphabets for N-methyl amino acids.
# Use "X", "1", "2", "3", "4", or "5" for a linker, an unusual amino acid or any molecule that requires both coupling and fmoc deprotection and place the solution in the position assigned to "X" or "1-5" respectively.
# Use "Z", "6", "7", "8", or "9" for a chelator, an unusual amino acid, or any molecule that requires only coupling and place the solution in the position assigned to "Z" or "6-9" respectively.
# Use "*" for pausing the synthesis.
# Use "!" for ivDde deprotection and place the hydrazine solution in the position assigned to "!".
# Use "@" for onresin oxidation and place the thallium solution in the position assigned to "@".
# Use "$" for end-capping and place the acetic anhydride solution in the position assigned to "$".
